Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(log(n))
The binary search approach reduces the search space by half with each comparison, leading to logarithmic time complexity.
Space Complexity: O(1)
The algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
Documenting Complexity in 6-peak.txt:
The complexity of the algorithm is O(log(n)) due to its use of binary search principles to efficiently find a peak in the list of integers.
To clarify the complexity of the algorithm used to find a peak in an unsorted list of integers:

The approach taken utilizes a binary search-like method to efficiently locate a peak element. Hereâ€™s the breakdown:

Complexity: O(log(n))
Explanation:
Binary Search Approach:
The algorithm divides the search space in half with each comparison.
It checks the middle element and decides whether to move left or right based on comparisons with neighboring elements.
This halving of the search space gives it a logarithmic time complexity.
Conclusion:
The algorithm efficiently finds a peak with a time complexity of O(log(n)).
This complexity is derived from the fact that the algorithm reduces the search space exponentially,
 making it suitable for large lists of integers while maintaining efficient performance.
